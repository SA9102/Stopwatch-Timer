# Stopwatch/Timer

**(My first React Native project)**

A React Native application with stopwatch and timer functionalities. You can also switch between light and dark mode.

As this is my first React Native application, it is quite simple and even lacks some expected functionality, such as an alarm sound, and having the stopwatch/timer on when the app is minimised. ***There is even an issue where the stopwatch and timer are slightly slow.*** However, the goal of this first project was not to create a perfect or complex application, but simply get a feel for the framework.

## How To Run

To run the program on a physical mobile device (Android or iOS), ensure that the device is connected to the same wireless network as your computer. Then, navigate to the root directory (which is 'stopwatch') and run the following command:
```
npx expo start
```
Install the Expo App on your mobile device, and use the QR code scanner in the app to scan the QR code.
