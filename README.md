# Stopwatch/Timer

**(My first React Native project)**

A React Native application with stopwatch and timer functionalities. You can also switch between light and dark mode.

As this is my first React Native application, it is quite simple and even lacks some expected functionality, such as an alarm sound, and having the stopwatch/timer on when the app is minimised. ***There is even an issue where the stopwatch and timer are slightly slow.*** However, the goal of this project was not to create a perfect or complex application, but simply get a feel for the framework.
